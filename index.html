            <h1>Independent Projects</h1>
            <p> As part of an effort to develope myself, I have taken on many independent projects. For example, I find that I learn best in a hands-on environment, while teaching others, or while learning about things I'm passionate about. 
            <p> Here, you will see some of the many examples of my work. First, I was able to create a site that gave a basic overview on Laptop and Device maintenance. I took away experience on how to format web pages and a greater understanding of how to use code editors.</p>
            <p> Next, my podcast is vital to my learning. In highschool, my geometry teacher made us complete an assignment where we had to create an instruction video for the class. From this, I found that I comprehend concepts more deeply when I am explaining it to others. </p>
            <p> Finally, I included one of the many certificates I obtained in my free time. I love exploring sites like LinkedIn Learning, Forage, Coursera, and even my jobs personal training sites for chances to learn new skills and practice them in challenges. Afterall, that's how I discovered my first hackathon! </p>
